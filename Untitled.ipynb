    "This is a bit more complicated than it first appears. It looks as though a lot of dupicate data was uploaded to the database at some point, and some of the duplicates have incorrect method names. For the Ontairo lakes, the same values have been uploaded both as DOC (in mg-C/l) and as \"DOCx\", which is in umol-C/l. The conversion factor from DOCx to DOC is therefore 0.012, which is very close to Heleen's estimated correction factor of dividing by 100. The problem is that the database appears to be selecting which values to display more-or-less at random. This is illustrated below."

However, if `method_id=10313` is not available, the database uses the values for `method_id=10294` instead, and these values are wrong. The problem is that this selection isn't deliberate: the database only prefers `method_id=10313` because it appears lower in the table than `method_id=10294`. Essentially, it's just a fluke that most of the data turn out OK - it could easily have been the other way around.\n",
