    "This notebook continues the work described [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/icpw/blob/master/toc_trends_oct_2016.ipynb), where my latest trends code was modified and tested. My aim here is to use the code to generate trends results for three key periods of interest (see e-mail from Heleen 19/10/2016 at 10:24):\n",

    "as well as creating a fourth set of results using all of the data available for each site. This latter set of results will hopefully help to identify any further obvious data issues (strange values etc.).\n",

    "**Update 27/10/2016:** A few additional modifications have been made to the trends code, so that it now includes the number of non-missing values in the first and last 5 years. See e-mail from Heleen received 25/10/2016 at 15:56 for details. The code now performs the following additional calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    " * If start and/or end years are specified, the output includes the columns `n_start` and `n_end`, which specify the number of non-null values within 5 years of the start and end years, respectively. <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " * If start and/or end years are not specified, the `n_start` and `n_end` columns record the number of non-null values within 5 years of the start and end of the data series.\n",
    " \n",

Be sure to **set the encoding** to `65001: Unicode (utf-8)` and **set the column data types explicitly**, otherwise Excel will truncate some of the NFC site codes and the special characters in the station names won't reproduce properly. (NB: there are still some problems with special characters in the station names, because in many cases RESA2 is storing names that are already corrupted. I don't have time to fix this now - it's another database issue to add to the list. The workflow described here should faithfully reproduce whatever's in the database, which is the best I can do at present). Check the file looks OK (`data_vis_all.xlsx`). <br><br>\n",

Next, check the column types are correct. In particular, `lat` and `lon` need be set to define the locations and the `link` column needs to set to `Text > Link`. Then switch to map view, click `Change feature styles` and style the map based on the entires in the `symbol` column. Turn on the `Terrain` option in map view if you want to. <br><br>\n",
