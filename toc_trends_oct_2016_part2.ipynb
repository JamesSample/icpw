Be sure to **set the encoding** to `65001: Unicode (utf-8)` and **set the column data types explicitly**, otherwise Excel will truncate some of the NFC site codes and the special characters in the station names won't reproduce properly. (NB: there are still some problems with special characters in the station names, because in many cases RESA2 is storing names that are already corrupted. I don't have time to fix this now - it's another database issue to add to the list. The workflow described here should faithfully reproduce whatever's in the database, which is the best I can do at present). Check the file looks OK (`data_vis_all-xlsx`). <br><br>\n",

Next, check the column types are correct. In particular, `lat` and `lon` need be set to define the locations and the `link` column needs to set to `Text > Link`. Then switch to map view, click `Change feature styles` and style the map based on the entires in the `symbol` column. Turn on the `Terrain` option in map view if you want to. <br><br>\n",
