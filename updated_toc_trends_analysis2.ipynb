    "# Updated TOC trends analysis (part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins to explore trends in the broader water chemistry dataset collated by Heleen, Don and John for the updated TOC analysis. Note that **the results presented here should be considered preliminary as there are still some outstanding database \"cleaning\" tasks that I haven't found time for yet**. The reason I'm jumping ahead of myself here is because I suspect the best way to identify any further data issues is to attempt the trend analysis and see what problems crop up.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original plan - as agreed with Heleen, Don and John in May - was to tidy up the data as much as possible and then simply re-run Tore's code for the trends calculations. Unfortunately, although I've managed to find most of the necessary code (either within RESA2 or as VBA projects within linked Access databases), I have been unable to locate some of the crucial subroutines, including the ones for the bulk of the statistical analysis. In addition, as far as I can tell, the code relies on an old, third-party Excel macro for the statistical calculations, and using this involves a lot of data shuffling (first from RESA2 to Excel, then into Access and finally back into RESA2), which is quite slow and difficult to keep track of.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I *have* found in RESA2 is a table called `ICPW_STATISTICS3`, which appears to store the output of Tore's analysis. I think my best option is therefore to recode the whole thing from scratch, and then compare my results with those in Tore's table to make sure what I'm doing is more-or-less compatible with what's been done before. This will involve digging into the internlas of RESA2, which will hopefuily be a good learning experience for me as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Trend analysis code\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides an overview of the code I've written for the updated trends analysis. The code was initially developed in an [earlier iPython notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/updated_toc_trends_analysis.ipynb) and later moved into a `.py` file to allow the trends functionality to be imported into other notebooks. This Python file is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "C:\\Data\\James_Work\\Staff\\Heleen_d_W\\ICP_Waters\\TOC_Trends_Analysis_2015\\Python\\toc_trends_analysis.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** The code in the Python file is slightly different and more sophisticated than in the original notebook. **Use the Python file (not the notebook) as the basis for any further developments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run an analysis, the user must provide a list of valid RESA2 **project names**, plus start and end years for the period of interest. Optionally, it is possible to specify a folder where trend plots for each parameter will be stored. The code then performs the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Identifies all the monitoring stations associated with the specified projects. <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Generates a list of water samples and sampling dates for all these stations within the period of interest. If some stations have no samples within the specified period, a **warning message** is printed and the list of stations with no data is included in the output. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note that RESA2 sometimes includes measurements for samples collected at several different water depths. The code currently only selects **near-surface water samples** (depth $\\leq 1 \\; m$). **Check this with Heleen**. <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Extracts the data for the key trends parameters (currently `'SO4', 'Cl', 'Ca', 'Mg', 'NO3-N', 'TOC'` and `'Al'`, but this need amending - see below) for the selected water samples and converts the raw values from the units and methods originally specified into the RESA2's \"standard\" units (as specified in the `RESA2.PARAMETER_DEFINITIONS` table). <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Checks for duplicate measurements of the same parameter at the same sampling point and date. If duplicates are found, the values are **averaged** and a **warning message** is printed. A list of duplicated records is then included in the output to facilitate data checking.  <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 5. Sampled values are aggregated from the native data collection interval to **annual frequency** by taking **medians**.  <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. For the parameters `'SO4', 'Cl', 'Mg', 'Ca'` and `'NO3-N'`, concentrations are recalculated as $\\mu eq/l$ (denoted by the prefix 'E' e.g. ESO4).\n",
    " \n",
    " $$EPAR \\; (\\mu eq/l) = \\frac{1.10^6 * valency}{molar \\; mass \\; (g/mol)} * PAR \\; (g/l)$$ <br><br>\n",
    " \n",
    " 7. Sea-salt corrections are then applied for the parameters `'ESO4', 'EMg'` and `'ECa']` (denoted by the suffix 'X' e.g. ESO4X). \n",
    " \n",
    " $$EPARX = EPAR_{sample} - \\left[ \\left( \\frac{EPAR}{ECl} \\right)_{ref} * ECl_{sample} \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    **NB:** I'm not sure what reference ratios were used in the original analysis. I've attempted to back-calculate them from RESA2, and it looks as though a single value has been assumed worldwide for each parameter? **Check this with Heleen**. Also, **see section 4.1.2 of the [code development notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/updated_toc_trends_analysis.ipynb) for more details**. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " 8. Calculates **combined parameters** e.g. `ESO4_ECl` is calculated as $(ESO4 + ECl)$ etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "    At present, the code generates annual time series for the following parameters:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      * `ESO4` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ESO4X` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ECl` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ESO4_ECl` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ECa_EMg` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ECaX_EMgX` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ENO3` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `ESO4_ECl_ENO3` ($\\mu eq/l$)\n",
    "      * `TOC` ($mg C/l$)\n",
    "      * `Al` ($mg/l$)\n",
    "\n",
    "    **NB:** It looks as though Tore's code calculates a few additional parameters as well:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      * `ANC`\n",
    "      * `ALK`\n",
    "      * `HPLUS`\n",
    "      * `ENO3_DIV_ENO3_ESO4X`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    These will be easy to add, but I'd like to check exactly **which parameters are of interest and how they should be calculated** before including them. <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " 9. Performs statistical analysis for each parameter at each site for the period specified. The output includes the following summary statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Period over which data are available (i.e. start and end years, which are not always the same as the period originally specified)\n",
    "    * Number of non-missing values\n",
    "    * Median of data values\n",
    "    * Mean of data values\n",
    "    * Standard deviation of data values\n",
    "    * Standard deviation expected under the null hypothesis of the [Mann-Kendall (M-K) test](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trend/vignettes/trend.pdf)\n",
    "    * M-K statistic\n",
    "    * Normalised M-K statistic $\\left(= \\frac{M-K \\; statistic}{Expected \\; standard \\; deviation} \\right)$\n",
    "    * M-K p-value\n",
    "    * Sen's slope (a.k.a. the [Theil-Sen slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator)). Optionally, a plot of the trend line can be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that the algorithm uses the [normal approximation](http://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/Vsample/Design_Trend_Mann_Kendall.htm) to estimate the variance of the `S` parameter in the M-K test (and thereby the significance of any trends). This approximation is only robust when the number of non-null data points in the time series is $\\geq 10$. If the number of non-missing values is fewer than 10, the code prints a **warning message** to indicate significance estimates may be unreliable.  <br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    " 10. The output from the algorithm consists of (i) **a dataframe of summary statistics** for each parameter at each site over the period of interest; (ii) **a list of stations with no data** in the period specified and (iii) **a list of duplicated values** (where the database contains two measurements of the same parameter at the same location on the same day). If the `plot` option is set to `True` when the function is called, the code will also output (iv) **plots of the Theil-Sen regression line** for each parameter, saved to the specified output folder.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 2. Illustrative example and testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This section illustrates how the code can be used to estimate trends. As a basic test, I'll start by reading some results from Tore's `ICPW_STATISTICS3` table, which I believe stores the output from his statistical analyses. I'll then run my code for the same stations and time periods to make sure the results are comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** My [earlier notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/updated_toc_trends_analysis.ipynb) focussing on the code development includes some more rigorous testing.\n",

    "Note that all these records have the same `sample_id`, which means the problem is not related to samples being entered into the database more than once. Instead, the problem seems to be due to entering multiple methods for the same parameter: `method_id = 10265` corresponds to NO3-N concentrations measured in $\\mu g/l$, whereas `method_id = 10308` refers to NO3-N in $mg/l$. As the data is extracted for the trends analysis, my code automatically converts all NO3-N measurements into $\\mu g/l$, which is why we end up with duplicate values of 25 and 110 in the trends results (see above). The puzzle is **where do these values come from in the first place**? $110 \\; \\mu g/l$ is, after all, a lot more than $25 \\; \\mu g/l$.\n",

    "### 5.1. Review of data\n",
    "\n",
    "I've worked my way through all the ICP-Waters data in the database and have cleaned things up where possible. The notebooks [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/toc_trends_2015_data_cleaning.ipynb) and [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/toc_trends_2015_data_cleaning2.ipynb) describe the progress to date and the main outstanding issues. In particular, I've deleted and reloaded a large proportion of the  Czech water samples, many of which were associated with the wrong site codes. I've also identified a number of sites (mostly Swedish and Canadian) for which we have incomplete site metadata and/or very limited water chemistry measurements. Where data are missing, I've contacted the relevant Focal Centres to determine whether more complete information exists and can be made available.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still a number of datasets on the network which have not been added to the database. Most of these are associated with locations where the main data contact is no longer very responsive (e.g. Hungary or Slovakia) and where there are issues regarding the raw data that has been supplied. In addition, datasets for Russia and the Netherlands have been supplied relatively recently, but in a format that will require significant work before they can be added to the database. I haven't got around to this yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. Review US sites\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tidied up the US sites in the database based on the information in John's e-mails - full details are in [this notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/toc_trends_2015_data_cleaning.ipynb). There are stil a few (fairly minor) outstanding issues, but I've contacted John about these.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. Land cover proportions and mean catchment elevation\n",
    "\n",
    "I've added this information where possible and have also included a request for improved site metadata in the 2016 \"call for data\". I've already had responses from e.g. Italy and Switzerland, which have allowed me to substantially improve the station descriptions for these countires. Hopefully others will respond similarly later in the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Norwegian sites, I've done a bit of watershed processing to refine the catchment properties (see [section 2 of this notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.googledrive.com/host/0BximeC_RweaeUy1jd2k3Nm1kdms/toc_trends_2015_data_cleaning2.ipynb#2.-Norway-sites)), but there is still a substantial amount of work required before we have a complete set of metadata for the Norwegian catchments.

This work is not finished yet (I need to extend the code to include a few more parameters), but the basic framework is complete and seems to be working OK. The code is easy to re-run and so, as long as Heleen, Don and John are happy with the baisc output, it should be fairly straightforward to repeat and adapt the trends analysis and necessary. It would be useful to have a discussion on how the output could be modified and extended to make it more useful.\n",
